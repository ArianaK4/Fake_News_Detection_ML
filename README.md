Fake News Dectection - Machine Learning 2023

In this project, we are going to detect fake news from a dataset. The steps that we will take include:

- Data collection: the data will be collected by web crawling different news websites and after collecting 
the data, we will convert them into a big dataset;
- Data Preprocessing: the dataset will be preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, 
and cleaning the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters;
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA will be performed to understand the distribution of fake and real news
articles in the dataset;
- Model Selection: for model selection we will use some supervised algorithms and also deep learning. Supervised
models that we will use include: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive-Bayes, Support Vector 
Machines (SVMs), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)??;
- Model Training: Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets and train the selected model on the 
training data;
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing data using metrics such as 
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
